# overview
* Playing with the Django and, more specifically, the django REST framework for building scalable APIs
* Building very simple app that contains a couple tables: one for season stats by player and another for a player detail
* The purpose of this repo is to solidify my understanding the Django REST framework, and perhaps even share this as a demo in the future.
